# API testing best practices
* Test for epected result
* Add stress to the sysytem by adding series of API load tests
* Group API tests by categories
* Create test cases with all possible input combinations for complete test coverage
* Prioritize API function calls to make it easy to test
* Create tests to cover unforseen circumstances
* Automate API testing wherever possible

# Some common tests
* Verify return value is based on input conditions i.e response tallies with request info sent
* verify system authenticates the outcome when API is updating data structure 
* Verify whether an API request triggers some events or another API request
